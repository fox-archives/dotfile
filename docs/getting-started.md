# Getting Started

**_NOTE_**: DO NOT USE _YET_

## Prerequisites

- Decent familiarity with Bash scripting
- Familiarity with Git

## Initialization

There is an initialization script to automatically generate the directories that `dotmgr` uses

```sh
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperupcall/dotmgr/main/scripts/init.sh | bash
```

- Do not create functions that start with `_`. These are reserved by use by `dotmgr` itself
