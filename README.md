# dotmgr

dotmgr is a collection of utilities I use for dotfile boostraping and general system maintenance. These files could be a [Basalt](https://github.com/hyperupcall/basalt) package, but I've opted not to do that for simplicity and reliability

Previously, the source lived at [hyperupcall/dots](https://github.com/hyperupcall/dots), but the source has been extracted with [git-filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) and now live here.

The goal of moving the dotfile manager here is to decouple dotfile configuration with the generic actions associated with managing dotfiles

Soon, I hope to workshop this repository as to be easily usable by others (including myself)

## Old

This was originally procured in [hyperupcall/dots-bootstrap](https://github.com/hyperupcall/dots-bootstrap), but has sinced moved here for easier maintenance

Components from [hyperupcall/dotshellextract](https://github.com/hyperupcall/dotshellextract) and [dotshellgen](https://github.com/hyperupcall/dotshellgen) have also been merged with dotmgr
