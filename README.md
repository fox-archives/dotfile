# dotmgr

I use `dotfile` to manage my dotfiles. It's a framework that eases dotfile deployment. It's got quite a few nifty and helpful features that may be of use to others, so I've opted to extract the sources from my main [dotfile repository](https://github.com/hyperupcall/dots).

It's going through a significant refactor as to be usable by anybody. Once that's done, I'll add documentation so it's straightfordward to integrate with your own dotfile repositories
